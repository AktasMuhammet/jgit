    If it is set to true skip computing the git index checksum. This
    accelerates Git commands that manipulate the index, such as git add, git
    commit, or git status.

Shortcut during git fetch for avoiding looping through all local refs
Allow the exclusions of refs prefixes from bitmap index generation
581267 PackWriterBitmapPreparer: do not include annotated tags in bitmap index
Speedup GC listing objects referenced from reflogs
580310 Add option to allow using JDK's SHA1 implementation
